# ANALOG LAYOUT AND PHYSICAL VERIFICATION OF LDO WITH BGR:
The Project delves into the design and physical verification of an integrated LDO and BGR system, highlighting the methodologies, challenges, and results that define the state-of-the-art in this domain. Through a detailed exploration of design principles, layout techniques, and verification processes, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of these critical components and their role in modern IC design.

| Technology Used | 40nm | 
|----------|----------|
|  Tool  | Cadence Virtuoso | 
| Simulation and verification  | LVS + DRC  |
| Design Techniques | Common-centroid, inter-digitization | 


## Objectives  
- Design and optimize the **layout of an LDO with BGR**  
- Minimize **parasitic effects** and **layout-dependent mismatches**  
- Ensure compliance with **Design Rule Checks (DRC)** and **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)** verification  
- Implement a **robust power mesh** to minimize **IR drops**  
- Perform **physical verification** using **Cadence Virtuoso and Siemens Calibre**  

##  Methodology  
1. **System-Level Requirements** – Define voltage accuracy, temperature stability, and power efficiency.  
2. **Circuit Design** – Implement **BGR (Bandgap Reference)** and **LDO (Low Dropout Regulator)** with precise layout techniques.  
3. **Layout Design** – Apply **common-centroid matching, inter-digitization, and guard rings** to minimize mismatches.  
4. **Physical Verification** – Perform **DRC, LVS, ERC** checks to ensure manufacturability and reliability.  
5. **Simulation & Testing** – Validate through **Monte Carlo and post-layout simulations**. 

## Applications  
- **Consumer Electronics** (smartphones, wearables)  
- **Automotive Systems** (ADAS, battery management)  
- **Medical Devices** (implantable sensors, monitoring systems)  
- **IoT Devices** (low-power sensors, wireless modules)
